      <p className="about-content">
        A seasoned software developer with 7+ years of experience, I specialize in building clean, efficient, and impactful solutions â€”whether
        it's crafting user-friendly interfaces, designing robust backend systems,
        or debugging that one stubborn error. When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m balancing life as a new mom
        (my most rewarding "project" yet) and indulging in my passions for photography and storytelling.
      </p>
      <p className="about-content">
        I thrive on solving complex problems and bringing ideas to life through technology,
        all while juggling the beautiful chaos of motherhood. With a love for travel and a sharp eye for detail,
        I bring creativity and perspective to everything I doâ€”both in work and in life.
      </p>

        Letâ€™s build something amazing together (bonus points if it involves coffee)! ðŸš€
